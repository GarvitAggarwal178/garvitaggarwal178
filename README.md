# Hi, I'm Garvit Aggarwal

I'm a computer science undergrad at VIT Vellore, deeply focused on building a career at the intersection of artificial intelligence, infrastructure, and backend systems.

I believe in doing things differently â€” not just following trends but building what's ahead of the curve. Right now, Iâ€™m pursuing two parallel tracks:

- **AI Research & Systems**: Iâ€™m building toward becoming one of the top AI researchers globally. My focus areas include reasoning-efficient models, neurosymbolic systems, and AI infrastructure tooling. Iâ€™m actively prototyping ideas, reproducing frontier papers, and exploring open-source contributions that redefine whatâ€™s possible.

- **Backend, Infra & Systems Engineering**: I also enjoy the rigor of well-designed software systems. I'm working on scalable microservices, developer tools, observability pipelines, and system design challenges that bridge the gap between code and production.

Most of my work is project-driven â€” I build first, publish later. I track everything in Obsidian, automate my workflows where possible, and use GitHub as a living portfolio of ideas in motion.

### Current Goals

- Reproduce 3+ cutting-edge AI papers from scratch
- Release open-source tooling around model introspection, RAG, or continual learning
- Build backend systems that hold up under real-world load and complexity
- Land elite internships that test me at the infrastructure or research frontier

If you're working on similar things or think we should collaborate, feel free to reach out.

â€”
Garvit
